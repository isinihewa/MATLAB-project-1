Modeling and Forecasting Seasonal Time Series Data Using Ratio-To-Moving Average Approach.

This project explores the use of seasonal indices to analyze and forecast seasonal patterns in time series data using the ratio-to-moving-average method. A custom MATLAB implementation was developed to compute seasonal indices for real seasonal datasets, including a quarterly toys sales dataset. The analysis revealed lower-than-average performance in the first two quarters and higher-than-average performance in the latter half of the year. The results demonstrate that this method is both effective and flexible for identifying seasonal variations and improving forecasting accuracy.

Both Additive and Multiplicative seasonal models are included, along with deseasonalization, trend estimation, and forecasting.

The MATLAB scripts take a seasonal dataset from Excel, convert it into a structured format, calculate seasonal indices, deseasonalize the series, fit a trend line, and generate forecasts with visualizations.
